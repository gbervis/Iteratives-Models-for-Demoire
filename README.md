# Iteratives-Models-for-Demoire
This repository presents experiments on iterative models developed for demoiré of digital images, specifically those affected by moiré patterns resulting from photographing screens.

## Repository Structure

- **`Iterative Model - Testing ...`**: Contains the evaluation scripts for the demoiré models. These scripts run inference on test images and compute performance metrics.
  
- **`Iterative Model - Training ...`**: Houses the training code used to optimize the iterative demoiré models.

- **`results_test_model ...`**: A dictionary (saved as a `.pkl` file) that stores per-image evaluation metrics for each model, enabling detailed analysis and comparison.
